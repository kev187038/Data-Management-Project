Sentiment Analysis by Type: Calculate the average sentiment score for each type of word (verb, adjective, noun).

Average Synonym/Antonyms/Hypernyms/Hyponyms per word: Calculate average number of Synonyms/Antonyms/Hypernyms/Hyponyms per word 

Word Frequency Analysis: Determine the frequency of each word type (verb, adjective, noun) in your database.

Synonym Analysis: Identify words with the most synonyms and analyze their sentiments. Do words with more synonyms tend to have a more neutral sentiment?

Antonym Analysis: Explore pairs of words that are antonyms. Check if their sentiments are often opposite, or if there are exceptions.

Sentiment Correlation with Word Length: Analyze if there's any correlation between the length of a word and its sentiment. Do longer words tend to have more positive or negative sentiments?

Word Similarity Analysis: Using the synonym relationships, calculate the similarity between pairs of words based on sentiment. Do words with similar sentiments tend to be synonyms more often?

Top Positive/Negative Words: Identify the top words with the most positive and negative sentiments. Are there any patterns or common themes among them?

Word Frequency by Sentiment: Determine the frequency distribution of words based on their sentiment scores. This can help identify common sentiments associated with different words.

Top Synonym Groups by Sentiment: Identify groups of synonyms with similar sentiment scores. This can help understand how sentiment is distributed across different groups of related words.

Sentiment Correlation with Word Frequency: Investigate if there's any correlation between the frequency of a word and its sentiment. Do more common words tend to have a certain sentiment?

Sentiment Patterns in Different Contexts: Analyze how the sentiment of words varies in different contexts or domains (e.g., social media, news articles, product reviews). Are there any consistent patterns?

Top Hypernyms/Hyponyms by Sentiment: Identify the top hypernyms and hyponyms based on their average sentiment scores. Do certain hierarchical relationships tend to have more positive or negative sentiments?

Sentiment Analysis of Word Pairs: Analyze the sentiment of pairs of words based on their relationships (e.g., synonyms, antonyms). Are there any consistent sentiment patterns in word pairs?

Sentiment Impact Analysis: Investigate how the sentiment of certain words or groups of words influences the sentiment of surrounding words or sentences. This can help understand the overall impact of sentiment on language.

Sentiment Analysis of Named Entities: Analyze the sentiment associated with named entities (e.g., people, places, organizations) mentioned in texts. This can provide insights into public opinion or sentiment towards specific entities.

Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis: Break down the sentiment of words based on specific aspects or features (e.g., product features in reviews, attributes of a person in social media posts). This can provide more granular insights into sentiment.

Sentiment Propagation in Synonym Chains: Analyze how sentiment propagates through synonym chains. Start with a seed word and traverse its synonyms, tracking sentiment changes along the way. This can help identify sentiment variations within synonym clusters.

Sentiment Influence Paths: Identify paths of influence where sentiment propagates from one word to another through intermediary relationships (e.g., synonym chains, hypernym paths). Analyze the impact of different paths on the final sentiment of a target word.

Sentiment Contextualization using Synonyms: Contextualize the sentiment of a word within its synonym set. Analyze how sentiment varies across synonyms and identify the contexts in which certain synonyms convey different sentiments

Sentiment Polarity Analysis in Relationship Networks: Analyze the polarity of sentiment relationships within the network of synonyms, antonyms, and hypernyms. Identify clusters of positively and negatively associated words and explore their semantic structures.

Sentiment Flow Analysis in Semantic Networks: Model the flow of sentiment within the semantic network by assigning sentiment scores to nodes and analyzing sentiment propagation through edges. Visualize sentiment flows to identify influential nodes and pathways.

Sentiment Path Length Analysis: Investigate the distribution of sentiment path lengths between words in the semantic network. Determine whether sentiment paths tend to be short and direct or longer and more indirect
